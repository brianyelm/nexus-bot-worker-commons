// lib/incomingPayment.js - Shared "is this money IN, not a vendor bill?" guard.
//
// Biller Genie is Black Raven's AR / customer-invoicing system. Anything from it
// is a CUSTOMER paying US (money in) and must NEVER become an ACCPAY vendor bill
// or be forwarded to Maxwell's AP inbox. This guard is the single source of
// truth shared by Wren's vendor-bill forwarder AND Maxwell's ap-inbox monitor
// (previously two drifting per-bot copies -- the drift is exactly why a client's
// Biller Genie receipt slipped through twice: 2026-06-03 and 2026-06-04).
//
// Discriminator priority:
//   1. Sender / body mentions our own white-label billing address
//      (hello@blackravenit.com). Biller Genie sends customer payment receipts AS
//      "Black Raven" from hello@; a copy lands in owner@, and Wren's native Graph
//      forward keeps "Original From: hello@blackravenit.com" in the body. A real
//      vendor bill is ALWAYS from an external vendor domain, never from us.
//   2. Any literal "Biller Genie" mention.
//   3. Unambiguous money-IN language (payout / deposited to your / you have
//      received a payment / customer payment received / has paid your invoice).
//
// NOTE: we deliberately do NOT match generic "payment received / thank you for
// your payment / your card was charged" phrasing -- a VENDOR's paid-receipt says
// the same thing and we DO want those booked (the auto-pay receipt flow). The
// sender is the safe discriminator; phrasing is not.

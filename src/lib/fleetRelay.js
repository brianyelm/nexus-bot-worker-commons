// lib/fleetRelay.js -- the fleet's only bot-to-bot handoff primitive.

// A relay is NOT one bot calling another bot's API. It is one bot posting a
// Nexus message that a second bot then acts on under ITS OWN credentials and
// ITS OWN tool set. The whole exposure in one sentence:
//
//     Wren has no CRM write access. Wren asked Jacob. A CRM record was written.
//
// That is the desired outcome for a prospect row and an unacceptable one for
// an invoice or an endpoint isolation. Four independent gates keep the second
// case impossible, each one sufficient on its own:
//
//   Gate 1  routing allowlist      -- who may be spoken to at all
//   Gate 1b watercooler bar        -- social chatter may not dispatch work
//   Gate 2  authority downgrade    -- what a bot-originated request may trigger
//                                     (enforced in handleChatMessage, policy here)
//   Gate 3  human origin + 1 hop   -- who may start one, and how far it travels
//
// Nexus enforces a fifth backstop underneath all of it: a bot-to-bot mention
// budget of 8 per channel per 10 minutes, fail-closed (message-insert.js).
//
// See docs/fleet-relay-design.md for the reasoning behind each gate.

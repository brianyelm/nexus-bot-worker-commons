// A sender filter is not an addressing filter. A bot that auto-replies to every
// message from a trusted sender will barge into threads where it was merely
// copied. 2026-08-17: Brian asked his payroll provider a question on a thread
// with four people on it, and Maxwell answered it as though he had been asked,
// telling Brian to go ask the provider that Brian was already talking to.
//
// The gate is deliberately strict: reply only when the bot is the SOLE To
// recipient and nobody is copied. A group thread is a conversation between
// humans until someone addresses the bot alone. Courtney has run this exact
// gate since 2026-05-18; this is that rule, lifted to commons so every bot gets
// it instead of each one rediscovering it.

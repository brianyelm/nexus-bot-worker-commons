// lib/brand.js -- the single source of truth for Black Raven's visual identity.
//
// Every client-facing surface in the fleet (ticket mail, e-signature requests,
// newsletters, client reports, support portals, one-pagers) used to carry its
// own copy of these values, which is how the arcade green and the pixel display
// face survived in eleven places after the site had moved on. Import from here
// instead of redeclaring, so a palette change is one edit and not an archaeology
// expedition.
//
// Deliberately dependency free and side effect free: standalone workers pull it
// in via the "./lib/brand" subpath export and bundle nothing else from commons.
//
// Matches blackravenit.com as of the 2026 redesign. No em/en dashes anywhere
// (hard fleet rule).
